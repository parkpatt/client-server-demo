Outputs for TestCase1 and TestCase2

Note:
    - The order of print statements in client_terminal and server_terminal will not be matching with what you get in your system
    - The ClientInput folder files Client0.txt and Client1.txt content will also vary depending on the way in which you traverse, but ensure that the load across the files is the same. The maximum allowed difference between the file contents is 1
    - The Output folder content should match
    - In case of TestCase1, ClientInput and Output folder should not be created.
